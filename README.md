# Real-Time Crop Production Analysis for Yield Improvement 
It contains EDA on various Crops in different seasons of year across the country.

# Inspiration
This project is to help farmers to know more about the crops and best way of farming, to make better decisions, and get an idea how to increase the yield of particular crop.By monitoring the seasons and whethers of different states of countrywe geta an idea of Indian Agriculutre Sector. 

# Interesting facts from exploratory data analysis
* Kerala is the highest crops producing state overall . It had produced more 500% crop than its runner up state Andhra Pradesh.
* Highest productive Years are 2011,2013 and 2014.
* Uttar Pradesh has largest area under agriculture.
* Mostly Production of crops is directly proportional to the Area.

# Orignal Development 
* Extract streaming Crop Data, preprocess data in Jupyter Notebook.
* Perform exploratory data analysis with Pandas & Seaborn to explore the insights.
* Connect with Plotly for real-time interactive dashboard based on time series.

# Challenges
* We can't tell perfectly about the whether.
* Government policies may cause change.
* Plotly doesn't have well-document on reference making customize dashboard much harder.
* More challenges on the way, but Google, StackOverFlow, Towards Data Science, and GitHub will always be your best friends
